steps:

npm install react-router-dom

Same as we used Link in nextjs we import it from react-router-dom in react 
link and navlink

we use to instead of href
NavLink provides some extra features like you make a className a callback in which you get a isActive prop.
which you can use for conditional css

then we have to create a router you can delete the app.jsx file

Layout similar to nextjs we can use layout for same header and footer
Layout.jsx   in layout you have to use outlet from react-router-dom
